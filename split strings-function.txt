 The code starts by declaring a string and then declares an array of pointers to strings.

 The code starts by analyzing the string "To be, or not to be, that is the question."
 which has 8 characters in it.

 It then goes through each character in the string one at a time and checks if there is any separator between them.

 If so, it increments i and continues on until i reaches len-1 (the length of the string).

 Then it allocates memory for an array of pointers to strings using malloc() with count as its size parameter.

 The next part of the code iterates over all possible combinations of separators found within "To be, or not to be,"
  checking if they are equal to NULL (a null pointer) or not equal to NULL (not a null pointer).

 If they are equal to NULL then break out from this loop because we have reached our end point;
 otherwise continue on until
 we reach our end point again where *count will now contain 1 more than what was originally stored inside
 split_strings[] since there was one less combination checked before this loop started executing.

 The code has the following functions: int main () char s[] = "To be, or not to be, that is the question.
 "; int count_strings = 0; char **split_strings = split (s, " ,.
 ", &count_strings); for (int i = 0; i < count_strings; i++) { printf ("\n%s", split_strings[i]); }
